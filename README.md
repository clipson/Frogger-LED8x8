# Frogger-LED8x8

My take on Frogger on an 8x8 LED matrix. 

There are three levels, and in each level, the user must get the dot ("frog") into the three bins at the top of the LED while avoiding the cars and trucks.

I used two buttons, an up button and a left button that wrapps around the screen, as inputs.
